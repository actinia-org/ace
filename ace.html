<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>

<em><b>ace</b></em> - actinia command execution
(<a href="https://actinia.mundialis.de">https://actinia.mundialis.de</a>).

<p>
The ace tool allows the execution of a single GRASS GIS command or
a list of GRASS GIS commands on an actinia REST service
(https://actinia.mundialis.de/). In addition it provides job management,
the ability to list locations, mapsets and map layer the user has
access to as well as the creation and deletion of mapsets.

<p>
The ace tool must be executed in an active GRASS GIS session and
will use the current location of this session to access the actinia service.
